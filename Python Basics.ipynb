Easy to learn and use : Python’s clean and readable syntax makes it a great choice for beginners. The language’s simple structure means that new developers can quickly start coding without being overwhelmed by complex syntax rules.\n","2. Versatility : Python is used in a wide range of fields, including web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask), data analysis (with libraries like Pandas and NumPy), machine learning and AI (using TensorFlow, Keras, etc.), automation, and scientific computing.\n","3. Large Community and Libraries : Python has a massive and active community, contributing to a rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. This means developers can easily find pre-written solutions for many tasks, speeding up the development process.\n","4. Cross-platform Compatibility : Python works on virtually every platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), which makes it highly portable. Developers can write code on one system and run it on another without significant changes.\n","5. Integration and Extensibility : Python can be integrated with other languages like C, C++, and Java, and it has strong support for third-party libraries. Additionally, it can call C/C++ libraries for performance-heavy tasks.\n","6. Popular in Data Science and AI : The explosion of interest in fields like data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence has further boosted Python’s popularity.

Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n","\n","Below are the points which tells why lists are mutable and tuples are immutrable -\n","\n","(i) Use Case and Purpose -\n","Lists are designed to be flexible and dynamic. They are meant to hold items that can change over time, like when you're working with collections of data where elements need to be added, removed, or modified. For example, if you're processing items in a loop and you need to add new items to a collection, a list is ideal.\n","Tuples, on the other hand, are meant to be fixed collections. They are used when you need an immutable sequence of data that won’t change. This can be useful for representing things like coordinates, fixed settings, or values that should remain constant throughout the program.\n","\n","(ii) Performance and Efficiency -\n","Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists because they are immutable. Since tuples can't change, Python can optimize memory usage by storing them more efficiently. This makes tuples faster in certain situations, especially when you're dealing with fixed collections of data that don't need to be modified.\n","Lists, being mutable, require more memory and have more overhead because they need to support operations like item insertion, deletion, or modification. The flexibility comes at the cost of performance.\n","\n","(iii) Safety and Integrity -\n","Tuples being immutable provides a guarantee that the data will not be accidentally altered. This is particularly useful when you need to ensure that the contents of a collection should not change, either within your program or when passing the tuple around to different parts of your code.\n","Lists being mutable can be modified, which makes them more flexible but also riskier in cases where data integrity is crucial. Modifying a list can sometimes lead to unintended side effects if you're not careful.\n","\n","(iv) Hashing and Usage in Dictionaries -\n","Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries or added to sets, because their content is guaranteed not to change. This makes them hashable, meaning their value can be used to calculate a unique hash that allows quick lookups in hash-based structures (like dictionaries and sets).\n","Lists, being mutable, are not hashable. If you tried to use a list as a dictionary key, Python would raise an error because its content can change, leading to an inconsistent hash value. This is why lists cannot be used as dictionary keys or set elements.\n","\n","(v) Data Integrity in Multiple Contexts -\n","When you pass a tuple to a function, the function cannot modify it. This helps ensure the integrity of the data you pass around, making it more predictable and safe, especially when working with critical data that should remain unchanged.\n","With lists, if you pass a list to a function, the function can modify the list's contents, which could lead to unintended side effects if the function is not carefully written.\n","\n","Example of List mutability -\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_list.append(4)  # You can modify the list\n","print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n","Example of Tuple immutability -\n","my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","# my_tuple.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError since tuples don't have append()\n","# my_tuple[0] = 10    # This would raise a TypeError because you can't modify a tuple\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RNsaKsObHa0Y"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["'''\n","7.
